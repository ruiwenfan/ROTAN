# ROTAN
The implementation code of ROTAN.

KG's implementation refers to RotatE: Knowledge Graph Embedding by Relational Rotation in Complex Space.

## Rebuttal 

The rebuttal_docs folder contains our answers to reviewers' questions. We hope these responses help you better understand our paper.

## Environment

Firstly, create virtual environment by conda ï¼š

`conda create -n rotan python=3.9.17`

Secondly, install [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/):

`pip install torch==1.13.1+cu116 torchvision==0.14.1+cu116 torchaudio==0.13.1 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu116`

Finally, install other dependencies :

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Hardware

GPU memory should be greater than or equal to 24576 MB.

## Dataset 
I obtained the compressed file in a Windows environment. If there is a problem when decompressing, it is recommended that you download and decompress the file in a Windows environment and use the csv file.

Download three datasets from [Datasets](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xsML0LIhTaF5x0rXmqwLsmwCKabFb-D5?usp=sharing) and create NYC, TKY and CA folder in dataset/ . Then, move three datasets to specified folder.(For example, move NYC_train.csv and NYC_val.csv to dataset/NYC).

## Pre-trained Graph

Download pre-trained graphs from [Models](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qVKTWVWL9qr8-yY7EKv3ZPk2YcEArEC5?usp=sharing) and move them to KG/models .

## Train

`nohup ./train_nyc.sh > nyc.txt &`

`nohup ./train_tky.sh > tky.txt &`

`nohup ./train_ca.sh > ca.txt &`

It should be noted that the CA dataset may be OOM(Out Of Memory). So in line 188 and 272 of [old_train.py](https://github.com/ruiwenfan/ROTAN/blob/main/old_train.py), we restrict the length of trajectory.

`if len(input_seq) < args.short_traj_thres or len(input_seq) >100:`

`if len(input_seq) < args.short_traj_thres or len(input_seq) > 100:`

In NYC and TKY dataset, you can remove `len(input_seq) >100`.
